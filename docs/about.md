# About the homepage

This homepage is meant to be a playground for my first steps in `markdown` and **github**.

I hope to find out if [github pages] is a good place to share some knowledge. 
My role model are the [ourworldindata.org] sites which are the perfect merge between a wikipedia page and an news article.
